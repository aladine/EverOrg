** Objective 
*** Migrate all content from Evernote to Org mode

    I'm a long term paying user of Evernote. I'm not happy with the
    new pricing policy. 

    In the past I've constantly switched between Org mode and a
    Evernote/Remember the Milk combination due to the lack of mobile
    support of Org mode. As this changes now due to the initiative of
    [[https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg.next][MobileOrg v2]], it's time to migrate my stuff fully over to Org
    mode.

    One of the reasons of using Evernote was the possibilty to export all
    of my content into xml. This project uses the Evernote
    backup-files to generate Org mode files. 

** Features
   EverOrg reads an Enex document and converts it's markup to Org mode
   syntax. This could be done by using tools like pandoc. But then all
   the attachments like images, voice-memos, scanned documents and so
   on would be missing from within org mode. 

   Evenrnote reads in the file which is given as a parameter and
   creates an Org file with the same name in the same location as the
   source file. In this location also an directory with the same name
   is created where all the attachments are stored.

   Every stored attachment is referenced from within the Org document,
   either as an image which could be viewed inline or as an link so
   that the attachment could be opened easily within n external application.

** Platform

   
    EverOrg is developed in Swift on MacOS. The aim is that EverOrg is
    platform independable so that Windows users have at least the
    possibilty to use it in a VM under Linux.

** Status 

*** Known Issues
    - Dropped whitespaces in nested Markups (sometimes)
    - Web clips are not nicely displayed in Org
      - tables have still some linebreaks in table cells
    - Only local images are processed. Remote images are ingnored
    - Illegal characters in tags (for Org) are not filtered
    - Lists are not processed (I do not have many of them)
    - Reminders are not processed (Those are still in RTM for me)
    - Very rarely a complex webclip could lead to unrecoverable parse
      errors. In this case no Org file is written. Removing the
      responsible note could resolve this issue temporarely.
    - Note content is not formatted for the use within Org
      mode. =fill-paragraph= (=M-q=) should do the job whilst
      accessing the note in Org mode.

** Discussion

*** Properties
    I do not know if there are already any existing keywords used for
    the properties I've been using for EverOrg. But if there are,
    those could be easily adopted.
