** Objective 

*** Migrate all content from Evernote to Org mode

    I'm a long term paying user of Evernote. I'm not happy with the
    new pricing policy. 

    In the past I've constantly switched between Org mode and a
    Evernote/Remember the Milk combination due to the lack of mobile
    support of Org mode. As this changes now due to the initiative of
    [[https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg.next][MobileOrg v2]], it's time to migrate my stuff fully over to Org
    mode.

    One of the reasons of using Evernote was the possibilty to export all
    of my content into xml. This project uses the Evernote
    backup-files to generate Org mode files. 

** Platform
   
    EverOrg is developed in Swift on MacOS. The aim is that EverOrg is
    platform independable so that Windows users have at least the
    possibilty to use it in a VM under Linux.
